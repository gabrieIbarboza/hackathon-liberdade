# Hackathon Liberdade ⛩️ - Ade Sampa

The Hackathon Liberdade was a weekend marathon aimed at promoting innovation through a positive competition of ideas and actions between teams. The proposed objective was to "increase the stay of visitors in the Liberdade neighborhood" by solving the problems faced by the neighborhood. The biggest challenge, however, was the need to conduct extensive field research in a few hours to identify real problems and propose innovative solutions.
