# Hackathon Liberdade ⛩️ - Ade Sampa

The Hackathon Liberdade was a weekend marathon aimed at promoting innovation through a positive competition of ideas and actions between teams. The proposed objective was to "increase the stay of visitors in the Liberdade neighborhood" by solving the problems faced by the neighborhood. The biggest challenge, however, was the need to conduct extensive field research in a few hours to identify real problems and propose innovative solutions.

## What was the main problem we identified?

Our team examined the problems of the Liberdade neighborhood using Design Thinking, as proposed by Miro Leite in his class, and identified a specific pain point: the lack of maintenance on the sidewalks, which causes a lot of stress for people, hinders the flow of visitors, and reduces the accessibility of the region for people with special mobility needs.

## What solution did we find?

Having identified this problem, we created a startup that serves as a bridge between the government and people seeking informal work but who want professional training, so that these people have the opportunity to repair the sidewalks of Liberdade with mentoring, finding this opportunity through our application.

## Our App

I had the task to create prototypes for our Pitch presentation, to show our app to the public. I used Figma software and below are the results:
