# Hackathon Liberdade ‚õ©Ô∏è - Ade Sampa

The Hackathon Liberdade was a weekend marathon aimed at promoting innovation through a positive competition of ideas and actions between teams. The proposed objective was to "increase the stay of visitors in the Liberdade neighborhood" by solving the problems faced by the neighborhood. The biggest challenge, however, was the need to conduct extensive field research in a few hours to identify real problems and propose innovative solutions.

## Shimeji Team üçÑ
<p>
  üçÑ I worked in a group with people I had never met before and who were quite different from me, but we managed to do an amazing job together!
</p>
<p>
  üçÑ All teams were given a Japanese dish as their name. Shimeji was designated as ours.

## Classes
<p>
  During my experience, I attended two essential classes.
</p>
<p>
  In the first class, Miro Leite taught me how to utilize Design Thinking to identify the underlying problem when presented with a challenge. This approach enables me to develop precise and effective solutions, rather than generating useless ones.
</p>
<p>
  In the second class, I learned the art of crafting an exceptional pitch to showcase my projects to the world. This skill ensures that my ideas are not only captivating but also persuasive enough to capture the attention of my audience.

## The challange
We have created a startup to achieve the Hackathon's proposed objective. In order to do that, we developed a business model canvas to make our strategy.

## What was the main problem we identified?

<p>
  Our team examined the problems of the Liberdade neighborhood using Design Thinking, as proposed by Miro Leite in his class, and identified a specific pain point: the lack of maintenance on the sidewalks, which causes a lot of stress for people, hinders the flow of visitors, and reduces the accessibility of the region for people with special mobility needs.

</div>

## What solution did we find?

Having identified this problem, we created a startup that serves as a bridge between the government and people seeking informal work but who want professional training, so that these people have the opportunity to repair the sidewalks of Liberdade with mentoring, finding this opportunity through our application.

## Our App

I had the task to create prototypes for our Pitch presentation, to show our app to the public. I used Figma software and below are the results:

### What have I learned?

<div align="center">
  <p>
    Participating in the Hackathon Liberdade provided me with a enriching experience that allowed me to develop skills such as teamwork, problem solving, and the use of innovative methodologies like Design Thinking. Additionally, I had the opportunity to meet inspiring people and learn from their stories and experiences. The creation of the startup to solve the problem identified in Liberdade was a rewarding achievement that left me motivated to continue seeking solutions to real problems in society.
